    <h1>Orientation</h1>
    <p>Met a <strong>bunch</strong> of people, received tour from Haley in HR, eventually met Sunil who told me
    my learning would proceed as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Learn about internet.</li>
      <li>Start Python and learn to use Git.</li>
      <li>Learn HTML/CSS.</li>
      <li>Learn Swift and iOS.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Learning the Internet</h1>
    <p>In the morning, learned from Scott the <em>basic</em> flow of data.  The data flows from the user
    through different "nodes" to an eventual spot, which then returns information to the user
    based on his or her request.  Each spot along the way is a different IP address which then
    refers the user to a different IP address.  This flow continues until the desired information
    is returned to the user.  Companies cache, or store, much information at different centers all
    over the world so if the info that I need is all the way in Australia, I can just access it
    from a much nearer cache, thus expediting the flow of information.</p>

    <h4>Important Players in Internet Providing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Verisign - owner of the "com" domain. Also main provider of authentication certificates.</li>
      <li>Symantec - security company.  Provides authentication certificates.</li>
      <li>Akumai (sp?) - cache company.  Stores data at crucial spots around globe.</li>
      <li>NFL - company that leases domain and stores info there that they want a consumer to see.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Binary to Webpage</h2>
    <p>There are databases owned and operated by companies that code binary into characters that are
    used all over the world.  The ascii database, for example is a 2 byte database.  Each byte
    contains 2^8 bits of information (each bit is either a 1 or a 0).  Thus, 2 bytes of information
    allows for 256 different combinations of 0 and 1.  However, the world uses way more characters
    than these, so some databases are 8 bytes, or 16, etc.  Essentially, these databases are the
    standards for turning 0s and 1s into what we see on the screen in front of us.</p>

    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p>Https is the secure server over which information is shared on the internet.  Using https,
    a PPK security protocol is followed.  This stands for Private/Public Key.  So let's say user1 and
    user2 are trying to securely share information. User1 possesses the user2 public key as well as
    the user1 public key and the user1 private key.  User2 possesses the user1 public key as well as
    the user2 public key and the user2 private key.  I can't quite remember how the flow of information
    works where the private keys are used to be sure that only the right eyes are viewing certain info.
    <strong><em>ASK QUESTION ABOUT THIS!!!</em></strong> Also, we discussed how hackers can forge signatures and verifications on
    messages that are meant to be private so that users end up sending messages that the hacker can decrypt
    rather than their intended recipients.  The way to avoid this is by using third party certificates so that a
    user can be absolutely sure of the individual from whom a piece of information has come.</p>

    <hr/>
    <p>By the way, the more you learn about web security, the more paranoid you get.</p>

    <h1>Coding</h1>
    <p>Used an online tutorial to learn the basics of webpage design and learned these things displayed on this page:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Titles</li>
      <li>Headings</li>
      <li>Paragraphs</li>
      <li>Unordered lists (like this one)</li>
      <li>Ordered lists</li>
      <li>Inline elements (emphasis and strong)</li>
      <li>Horizontal, thematic breaks</li>
      <li>HTML sets up the backbone, while CSS adds the flare</li>
