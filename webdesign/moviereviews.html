			<div class='movreview'>I loved this movie.  Heart pumping action from beginning to end.  Fans of the first will get more of the same in the second.  Our glimpse into the world of the assassins is broadened and we get immersed in their world.  The number of knee shots is only outdone by the number of headshots and I found myself enthralled by each one.  If you know what you're in for, and that is nonstop action start to finish, this movie will not disappoint.  That being said, don't expect a story-driven film, and if you are sensitive to loud noises, bring some ear plugs. </div>

			<div class='movreview'>Just phenomenal.  Used an inspiring and authentic soundtrack to propel a great movie into legendary status.  Since Disney broke off from Pixar to do its own computer animated films, it has produced wonderful films.  Moana is no exception.  The emotiional evocativeness of this film really drives home the fact that this is not just a fun family film, but a force to be reckoned with as purely a film.  Auli'i Cravalho debuted as an obvious future star and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson showed why he is the most in demand man in Hollywood.  I struggle to find any criticism of this movie, as I loved it from beginning to end.  Good luck getting the soundtrack out of your head, as it is infectious.</div>
